Swift classes that perform the Sieve of Atkin and the Sieve of Eratosthenes. There is an additional class that will calculate prime distribution statistics.

### Install
Download or clone to your Desktop and then drag the relevant file into your project.

### Usage
Both sieve classes take an `Int` as a function argument and return an array of `Bool` for which the prime numbers are marked as `true`. Each class also contains functions to print the prime numbers to the console, "consolidate" them into an array of `Int`, and "export" them as a `String`.

To generate all prime numbers up to 1,000 using the Sieve of Atkin and print them to the console, add the following to `main` or your `ViewController`.

```swift
let limit = 1000
var boolListOfPrimes = [Bool]()
boolListOfPrimes = SieveOfAtkin().SofA(limit)
SieveOfAtkin().printPrimes(boolListOfPrimes)
```

#####NB: The prime-counting function grows exponentially! Generating millions of primes could take several minutes or (quite a bit) more, depending on the speed of your computer.

The distribution stats class currently only handles modulo 3 and modulo 10. It calculates the number of primes for the reduced residual class (mod q) as well as the distribution of pairs of consecutive primes among the permissible Ï•(q)^2  pairs of the reduced residual classes (mod q). This class' functions require the consolidated array of primes of type `Int` as their argument.

```swift
let primes = SieveOfAtkin().consolidatePrimes(boolListOfPrimes)
let primeDistStatsString = PrimeDistributionStats().calcModThreeDistributionStats(primes)
```

### Improvements
While both sieve classes include some optimization, I'm sure further "tweaks" are possible. Report an issue to leave feedback on the algorithms themselves, or submit a pull request.
